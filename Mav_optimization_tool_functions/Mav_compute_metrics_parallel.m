%% Static matrix
% The static matrix are static allocation matrix that do not depend on the
% rotor orientation and speed.

% Vector containing all the decomposed vertical and horizontal forces:
% Fdec = [kf*cos(alpha(1))*w(1)^2; kf*sin(alpha(1))*w(1)^2;
%         kf*cos(alpha(2))*w(2)^2; kf*sin(alpha(2))*w(2)^2;
%
%         ...
%
%         kf*cos(alpha(n))*w(n)^2; kf*sin(alpha(n))*w(n)^2];

% the drone body
% F = m*p'' = A_F_static*Fdec (w.r.t. to the body frame)

% The Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse of the static matrices allow to find
% Fdec from a desired force or torque applied on the drone.
% The rotor orientation and speed can then be deduced from Fdec
% => Fdec = inv(A_F_static)*Fdes
